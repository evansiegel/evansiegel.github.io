    <h2>Denver Nuggets</h2>

<h3>What the Denver Nuggets can do with their cap situation</h3>
		<p>The Nuggets are going through a re-tooling phase. The team is
    coming off a tremendously successful playoff run that ultimately
    ended one round short of the NBA Finals at the hands of the Los
    Angeles Lakers.</p>
		<p>As so often happens, the Nuggets had a number of up-and-coming
      young starlets that excelled in elevated roles in the playoffs.
      This led to their price tags on the free agent market spiking
      and ultimately becoming too expensive for the already
      inflexible Nuggets. One way the team could get around this is
      to use the sign-and-trade exception.</p>

  <h4>Sign-and-trade provision</h4>

    <p>The sign-and-trade provision allows teams that are over the
      cap to re-sign one of their own free agents and immediately
      trade him to a team of his choice. This is done so a player
      who wants to join a particular team can do so even if they
      are not under the cap enough to make the signing.</p>

      <p>Essentially,the player agrees with his new team on
       a contract, and then signs the deal with his former team.
      That team instantly trades him and receives something,
      often draft picks, as compensation. This exception is useful
      for teams over the cap, but eager to still participate in the
      free agent process.</p>

    <p>For example, Jerami Grant enjoyed a stellar season with
      Nuggets in the last year of his contract. The Nuggets are
      aware of the fact he will have a number of teams interested in
      signing him, and doing so themselves would push them well
      over the luxury tax line. But losing a player as valuable as
      Grant for nothing is a worst-case scenario for the upstart
      Nuggets.</p>

       <p>The Houston Rockets are rumored to be among the teams
      looking to pry Grant away from Denver. Should Grant decide he
      wants to play in Houston, he should pursue a sign-and-trade.
      The Rockets do not have cap space, and therefore have to use
      an exception to pursue a player as expensive as Grant.</p>

      <p>The NBA allows teams to re-sign their own players
        and go over the cap to do so, so Grant can use his former
        team to get the contract he desires, while agreeing to be
        immediately traded to the Houston Rockets.</p>
