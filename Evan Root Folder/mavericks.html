<h3>How the Dallas Mavericks navigated the salary cap</h3>
		<p>The Dallas Mavericks are among the NBA's most aggressive teams
    from a roster building standpoint. The team's general manager,
    Nelson, is the son of NBA coaching legend and former player
    Don Nelson.</p>

    <p> Nelson joined the Mavericks in 1998, and was direclt
    involved in the acquisitions of both Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki
    in a three-team trade. It was the first time in league history
    two future MVPs were acquired in the same transaction.</p>

  	<p>The NBA uses what is called a "soft cap,'' allowing teams to
    exceed the caps as long as they use an exception. There are
    several main salary cap exceptions.</p>

    <h4>Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception</h4>
    <p>Each year, the NBA affords teams that are under the luxury
      tax line a mid-level exception to allow teams to exceed the
      cap at a certain rate each year. The Dallas Mavericks used
      this exception to sign Seth Curry to a four year, $32 million
      contract in the 2019 offseason.</p>

    <p>The Mavericks were over the salary cap, but used this
      tool to sign the player they wanted on the free agent market.</p>

    <h4>Bi-Annual Exception</h4>
    <p>Another exception the NBA offers to over the cap teams is the
      bi-annual exception. This is a cap exception that can only be
      used every other season. The contract offer can be no longer
      than two seasons. Naturally, this is among the least lucrative
      options to teams looking to remain over the cap and add talent
      through free agency.</p>

      <p>The Mavericks used this exception in the 2019 offseason to
        sign Serbian center Boban Marjanovic. Marjanovic stands
        tall at 7''4, making him the second tallest player in the
        NBA and second tallest in team history.</p>

       <p>The Mavericks will be unable to use this exception during
        the 2020 offseason, but Marjanovic's contract will remain
        on the payroll through both seasons unconditionally unless
        he is traded.</p>
