		<p>A CBA is a document signed between two parties by collective
     bargaining. Both the NFL and NBA use the CBA to negotiate
   terms play, contracts, basic basketball and football operations,
   and the full context of a league year.</p>
		<p>The NBA uses what is called a "soft cap,'' which allows teams
    to exceed the limit the league allows teams to spend on its
    players. This is done to both ensure parity, and allow teams
    in smaller markets like Memphis and Milwaukee to compete with teams
    in Los Angeles and New York.</p>

    <h3>What is a salary cap?</h3>

    <p>The NBA salary cap is a limit on which teams can spend money
      to acquire players.</p>

    <p><strong>Why have a salary cap?</strong></p>

    <p>The NBA wants to ensure that all 30 teams have what amounts to
     the same budget under the NBA rules, giving lifelines to small
   market teams and make sure that parity exists league-wide.</p>

    <p><strong>Has there always been a salary cap?</strong></p>

    <p>The NBA used a salary cap during its inaugural 1946--1947
    season, but abolished it after just one year. Bob Cousy
    originally organized the NBA Player's Union in 1954, which
    eventually led to the first Collective Bargaining Agreement in
    1970. The first modern salary cap was used in the
    1984-1985 season, set at $3.6 million.</p>

    <p><strong>How is the salary cap calculated?<p></strong>

    <p>The salary cap is annually calculated as a rough projection
    of that season's Basketball Related Income. The NBA takes 44.74%
    of projected Basketball Related Income, subtracts benefits, and
    then divides the result by the number of teams in the league.
    Several other adjustments are later made to the total.</p>

    <p><strong>What is Basketball Related Income?</strong></p>

    <p>There are over two dozen sources of income that contribute to BRI, including:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Broadcasting rights</li>
    <li>Game receipts(including exhibitions)</li>
    <li>Arena signage proceeds</li>
    <li>Arena tour proceeds</li>
    <li>Team promotion proceeds</li>
    <li>Beverage sale proceeds</li>
    <li>Team sponsorship proceeds</li>
    <li>Gambling proceeds</li>
    <li>Mascot proceeds</li>
    <li>Parking</li>
  </ul>
