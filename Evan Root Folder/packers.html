    <h3>Team salary cap breakdown</h3>
		<p>The Green Bay Packers have been known to be among the NFL's most
    frugal football teams when it comes to their salary cap management.
    Currently, the Packers have $183,885,279 in active contracts.
    The Packers are professional sports' <strong>only</strong>
     publicly-owned franchise, meaning the team is comprised of thousands
     of shareholders from across the country. </p>
		<p>The NFL uses a "hard cap", meaning no team can exceed it for any
    reason. Because of the nature of the sport, the NFL has more
    leverage over its players in collective bargaining.
    Currently, the Packers spend 50.55% of their cap space
    on offensive players, and 40.09% on defensive players.
    Remaining figures are given to special team players. </p>

     <p>The Packers are famous for being one of only a few teams
       that almost never uses the franchise tag, a cap tool
       exclusive to the NFL.</P>

    <h2>Franchise tag</h2>
    <p>The NFL uses what is known as a "franchise tag" as a mechanism of
      limiting player movement. Teams can use the tag on one of their free agents
      they are afraid of losing. A team has the right to use tag
      on only one player per season. The player becomes binded to
      the tagging team for the duration of that season.</p>

      <p><strong>What is a tagged player's salary?</p></strong>
      <p>Each year, the franchise tag numbers get updated as the
        salary cap goes up and down. The amount is calculated as
        120% of their current salary, or the average of the five
        highest paid players at their position over the previous
        five seasons, whichever is larger.</p>
