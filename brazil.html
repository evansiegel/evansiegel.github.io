   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>Brazil gained its independence in 1822 after centuries-long fighting with Portugal. For years, the country was dominated by coffee exporters until the populist leader Vargas took over in 1930. This military autocracy lasted until the mid-1980's.</p>
</section>

  <p>Slavery was abolished in the country in 1888. Nearly 100 years later, the military peacefully handed over power to the civilians and made it a democracy. The country underwent a difficult financial economic crisis in the late 20th century, but began turning things around at the turn of the century. Subsequently, the country was awarded the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The olympics and world cup did not have as positive an impact on the country as many excpected, and Brazil slid into a recession in 2017.</p>

   <p>During the most <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46013408">recent presidential election</a> that saw Jaire Bolsonaro rise to power, the country was bogged down by a gigantic political scandal known as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/12/brazils-democracy-suffers-another-blow-with-operation-car-wash-leaks/">"Operation Car Wash."</a> The scandal was so large, the lead prosecutor said it was bigger than Watergate, "tenfold." Over 200 people were charged by the Brazilian government, and the total amount of bribes that were handed out totalled over $2 Billion.</p>

  <p>Bolsonaro was not involved, but his history of controversial statements on a vareity of issues made him a deeply divisive candidate. Bolsonaro is a former military captain who has said unequivocally in the past that he is "in favor of a dictatorship." Bolsonaro won the election with 55% of the vote and has maintained power ever since.</p>

<h3>Constitution</h3>

<p>Amendments are proposed by at least one third of either house of congress, or by simple majority. Constitution was last ratified in 1988. The constitution made any crime against any minority or ethnic group unbailable.</p>
</article>


<p>The constitution allowed for minorities to seek damages from those who have attacked them based on a racist ideology. Crimes of torture were also ruled unbailable. Most of the punishment for these crimes came about as a result of decades of a brutal military dictatorship that resulted in the attacks and slayings of counltess citizens and opposition leaders.</p>


<h3>Houses of congress</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federal Senate</li>
<li>House of deputies</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court consists of 11 justices. Justices are appointed by the president, confirmed by the senate and then serve until mandatory retirement at 75.</p>

<article>
<h3>Elections and Appointments</h3>
<p>Both the president and vice president are elected on the same ballot by a popular vote. The election is conducted in two rounds. The first of which is a jungle system, similar to some primary elections in the United States.</p>
</article>

<p>If no candidate wins over 50% of the vote in the first round, even if one wins with a resounding plurality, the election advances to a second round runoff with the top-two vote getters. Presidents are limited to four-year terms.</p>
